# gujarati_audio_book
This is a prototype project created by two students Aayush Thacker and Sultan Khatri to give locals a website where they can read as well as hear audio books which are created by an A.I.
We used a Python library called flask to build the website and gtts to build the api that translates text to Aujarati audio and a tesseract modual that can read text from any image file.
